                        The fundamental questions from Plato onwards are these: 
                        How is it possible for us to represent reality? How is it 
                        that we can represent the external world of objects, of 
                        space and time, of motion and color? How do we represent 
                        the inner world of thought and desire, images and ideas, 
                        self and consciousness? Where do moral values come from? 
                        Since it is after all the nervous system that achieves 
                        these things, the fundamental question can be reformulated 
                        thus: How does the brain situated in its bodily 
                        configuration, within its surrounding physical 
                        environment, and within the social context it finds 
                        itself–how does the brain work?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The human brain is, of course, a product of biological 
                        evolution, and as we increasingly appreciate, evolution 
                        is remarkably conservative. Our brains are very similar 
                        in organization, neuronal components, and neurochemicals 
                        to the brains of chimpanzees, monkeys, rodents, and even 
                        in basic ways, to those of reptiles and fruit flies. 
                        Looked at from an evolutionary point of view, the 
                        principal function of nervous systems is to enable the 
                        organism to move so as to succeed at the Four F’s: 
                        feeding, fleeing, fighting, and reproduction. We cannot 
                        expect engineering perfection in the products of 
                        evolution. Improvements to a nervous system are not built 
                        by starting from scratch, but are modifications and 
                        extensions of what already exists. If we approach the 
                        problems of nervous system function strictly as 
                        engineering problems, setting our goals to figure out 
                        how a task could in principle be done, we may find a 
                        cunning solution that is nothing like what evolution 
                        has actually found. Unless we go into the black box, we 
                        risk wasting our time exploring remote, if temporarily 
                        fashionable, areas of computational space.

                    For decades, Patricia Churchland has contributed to the fields 
                    of philosophy of neuroscience, philosophy of the mind and 
                    neuroethics. Her research has centered on the interface between 
                    neuroscience and philosophy with a current focus on the 
                    association of morality and the social brain. A Professor 
                    Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of California, San 
                    Diego and Adjunct Professor at the Salk Institute, Pat holds 
                    degrees from Oxford University, the University of Pittsburg and 
                    the University of British Columbia. She has been awarded the 
                    MacArthur Prize, The Rossi Prize for Neuroscience and the Prose 
                    Prize for Science.  She has authored multiple pioneering books, 
                    her most recent being Touching a Nerve. She has served as 
                    President of the American Philosophical Association and the 
                    Society for Philosophy and Psychology. Pat lives in Solana 
                    Beach, California, with her husband Paul, a neurophilosopher, 
                    and their labradoodle Millie. They have two children, Anne and 
                    Mark, both neuroscientists.

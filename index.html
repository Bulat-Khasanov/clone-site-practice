                        <p>The fundamental questions from Plato onwards are these: 
                           How is it possible for us to represent reality? How is it 
                           that we can represent the external world of objects, of 
                           space and time, of motion and color? How do we represent 
                           the inner world of thought and desire, images and ideas, 
                           self and consciousness? Where do moral values come from? 
                           Since it is after all the nervous system that achieves 
                           these things, the fundamental question can be reformulated 
                           thus: How does the brain situated in its bodily 
                           configuration, within its surrounding physical 
                           environment, and within the social context it finds 
                           itself–how does the brain work?</p>
                        <p>The human brain is, of course, a product of biological 
                           evolution, and as we increasingly appreciate, evolution 
                           is remarkably conservative. Our brains are very similar 
                           in organization, neuronal components, and neurochemicals 
                           to the brains of chimpanzees, monkeys, rodents, and even 
                           in basic ways, to those of reptiles and fruit flies. 
                           Looked at from an evolutionary point of view, the 
                           principal function of nervous systems is to enable the 
                           organism to move so as to succeed at the Four F’s: 
                           feeding, fleeing, fighting, and reproduction. We cannot 
                           expect engineering perfection in the products of 
                           evolution. Improvements to a nervous system are not built 
                           by starting from scratch, but are modifications and 
                           extensions of what already exists. If we approach the 
                           problems of nervous system function strictly as 
                           engineering problems, setting our goals to figure out 
                           how a task could in principle be done, we may find a 
                           cunning solution that is nothing like what evolution 
                           has actually found. Unless we go into the black box, we 
                           risk wasting our time exploring remote, if temporarily 
                           fashionable, areas of computational space.<br>

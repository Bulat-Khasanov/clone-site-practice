                    Neurophilosophy – the idea that the nature of mental processes 
                    such as decision-making, problem-solving and so forth were 
                    supported by neurobiological mechanisms – was more or less 
                    inevitable, given the progress in neuroscience in the 1970’s. 
                    This progress revealed many links between higher functions, 
                    including consciousness and self-control, and neural activities. 
                    Because I happened to be the first to publish using the word, 
                    ‘neurophilosophy’, (the title of my 1986 book bore that name), 
                    I am regarded as a neurophilosophy pioneer.

                        Laura Jacobson’s <i>Brain Scapes</i> is based on axial MRIs of the 
                        human brain and draws on images of neurons and brain 
                        structures to create cerebral landscapes. A collection of 
                        her work is on permanent display at the Stanford Center for

                        In about 1978, I came to think that the arguments for the 
                        independence of psychology from any developments in 
                        neuroscience were too flimsy to be taken seriously. As a 
                        graduate student at Oxford I had been steeped in conceptual 
                        analysis as philosophers’ preferred method for exploring the 
                        nature of the mind. Also known as “armchair philosophy”, 
                        conceptual analysis as a way of find out about the nature of 
                        things seemed to me marginally worthwhile, and basically a 
                        dead end. Increasingly, I saw much of conceptual analysis as 
                        unconstrained speculation that ignored facts. Or, as our 
                        students sometimes put it, as just pulling it out of your ass.

                        If, as seems probable, there is no nonphysical soul, but only 
                        the physical brain, then surely what is known in neuroscience 
                        cannot help but be relevant to understanding the nature of 
                        psychological phenomena, including perception, 
                        decision-making, memory and learning. Although I have always 
                        emphasized that understanding neuroscience was necessary to 
                        understand the mind, some philosophers read me as saying 
                        neuroscience was both necessary and sufficient. This was a 
                        poorly disguised straw man wheeled out to make the 
                        neurophilosophical project look extreme and unappealing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To appreciate more exactly the contribution neuroscience 
                        might make, I recognized that I needed to know as much as I 
                        could about neuroanatomy (brain structure) as well as about 
                        the developments in neurophysiology (brain function). I paid 
                        a visit the head of the Neuroanatomy Department at the 
                        University of Manitoba Medical College, and explained my 
                        need. To my everlasting gratitude, he was anything but 
                        dismissive. Dr. Baskerville-Hyde (his real name) warmly 
                        welcomed me, and encouraged me to take courses and labs 
                        alongside the medical students. The arrangement was informal, 
                        since I was not enrolled as a medical student – I was, after 
                        all, still being paid to teach philosophy to undergraduates. 
                        Soon thereafter I was invited to attend neurology rounds and 
                        neurosurgical rounds with the clinicians, a weekly event in 
                        which patients with neurological conditions were presented, 
                        following which their cases were discussed in detail. In 
                        grand rounds, I could see for myself the cognitive deficits 
                        produced by brain damage. It was both an awesome and a 
                        humbling experience. After finishing all available courses, 
                        I then became associated with the spinal cord laboratory of 
                        Dr. Larry Jordan which was focused on the neural circuitry 
                        that maintained rhythmic walking motions. Here too I was 
                        welcomed, and in the Jordan lab, I began to dig much deeper 
                        into basic neuroscience. I should add that these scientific 
                        adventures were really a family affair, as Paul and I talked 
                        endlessly about what I learned at the Med School and the lab, 
                        and because we were obviously having great fun, the children 
                        often wandered into the conversations as well. This pattern 
                        of conversation has continued to the present.

                        Several factors encouraged us to be bold in our ideas about 
                        taking our work in philosophy in a new direction that linked 
                        with the biological sciences. One factor is rather simple. We 
                        were at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, and while it 
                        was a good school, especially in the plant sciences, we did 
                        not feel under great pressure to publish in what were regarded 
                        as the “big” philosophy journals – or indeed to publish at 
                        all. This was an invaluable gift. It allowed us time to think 
                        and explore, and to question the conventional wisdom. As 
                        Francis Crick said to me much later, it is important to be 
                        slightly under-employed; that is, it is important that your 
                        mind is not cluttered with trivia. At the beginning of our 
                        careers, this time and freedom was a godsend.

                        Second, perhaps owing to our rural experiences as children, 
                        we both had a kind of romantic view of the pursuit of truth; 
                        namely, that you should not have to kowtow to anyone, that even 
                        the Big Guns in the field might well be flat out wrong, and 
                        that evidence and data are what matter, as opposed to fancy 
                        rhetoric and charisma. To others this probably looked like 
                        intellectual arrogance, and in a sense I suppose it was. We 
                        just thought that the science of the mind/brain was the most 
                        exciting thing in the world. That we had an opportunity to 
                        really learn about the brain seemed like a grand piece of 
                        luck. On the other hand, our colleagues, especially those in 
                        the US, made lots of jokes at our expense, some with good 
                        humor, some in a pretty mean-spirited way. Nevertheless, we 
                        were so convinced that neuroscience was the future of the 
                        study of the mind, we let the jokes just roll off our backs, 
                        duck-like.

                        We moved to San Diego in 1984. This too was a godsend, a 
                        tremendous piece of good fortunte. University of California 
                        San Diego was then, and is still now, a world leader in the 
                        neurosciences, and it had an atmosphere of gleeful 
                        inter-discplinary collaboration which worked so well for us. 
                        Francis Crick, who had moved to the Salk Institute from 
                        Cambridge, had been pushing behind the scenes to move us to 
                        San Diego, mainly because he thought it was time for 
                        philosophy to take advantage of the sciences to make 
                        progress. We sort of filled the bill. While at Cambridge, 
                        Francis had tried to talk to Wittgenstein about consciousness, 
                        but apparently Wittgenstein was not interested. I had met 
                        Francis at a workshop at Johns Hopkins, and he was cheered by 
                        my eagerness to go whole hog into neuroscience. Hence he 
                        thought having us as neighbors, at UCSD across the street 
                        from the Salk, would be useful. He became a close friend, 
                        and I learned from him so much about how to think about and 
                        through and around a complex problem, such as the 
                        neurobiological basis of consciousness or self-control. 
                        Once his attention was focused on a particular problem, 
                        he was relentless, chewing away at it, reading everything 
                        relevant. Francis was fearless in trying out all kinds of 
                        theories on anyone available, and he was, if not happy to be 
                        wrong, at least not upset by it. This was all terrifically 
                        inspiring, of course, but in truth it was also tremendous fun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Francis was eager to build a neuroscience group at the Salk 
                        Insititute, and he had the foresight to realize it was 
                        essential to have a computational framework for making sense 
                        of what networks of neurons were doing. He convinced the Salk 
                        to hire Terry Sejnowski, clearly an innovator and rising star. 
                        Terry and Francis and I got along supremely well, and many 
                        wonderful things came from intense conversations at tea in 
                        Terry’s lab and lunch in the Salk cafeteria. One comment from 
                        Francis I particularly recall is his emphasizing “you must 
                        not fall in love with your theory. If it turns out to look 
                        like a dud, drop it and try a different tack.”

                            <strong>Conscience</strong> 
                            – The Origins of Moral Intuition
                        </h2>
                        <p class="about_book_text">
                            On first impulse, the word “conscience” seems easily defined 
                            as an innate knowledge of right and wrong. But if we think 
                            about the term more deeply, questions quickly arise. For 
                            instance, what one group defines as “right” is readily 
                            dismissed by another as “wrong.” Provocative, timely, and 
                            profound, Conscience is an upending examination of the roots 
                            behind our moral beliefs. With wisdom and unflinching 
                            scientific and philosophical insight, Patricia Churchland has 
                            written an eye-opening book that may seriously challenge 
                            everything we thought we knew about our best behavior.

                                human conscience is neurobiological in origin, rather 
                                than stemming, as contemporary philosophers commonly 
                                maintain, from universal moral laws. This 
                                intellectually rigorous yet highly readable work is 
                                well worth the time of anyone interested in why 
                                humans feel and think as they do.”

                                “In Conscience, Patricia S. Churchland explores how 
                                moral systems arise from our physical selves in 
                                combination with environmental demands. Conscience 
                                delves into scientific studies to deepen our 
                                understanding of whether people have a predisposition 
                                to embrace specific ethical stands. Churchland then 
                                turns to philosophy to explore why morality is 
                                central to all societies, how it is transmitted 
                                through the generations, and why different cultures 
                                live by different morals. Her unparalleled ability to 
                                join ideas rarely put into dialogue brings light to a 
                                subject that speaks to the meaning of being human.”

                            – What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality
                        </h2>
                        <p class="about_book_text"> 
                            What is morality? Where does it come from? And why do most of 
                            us heed its call most of the time? In Braintrust, Patricia 
                            Churchland argues that morality originates in the biology of 
                            the brain. She describes the “neurobiological platform of 
                            bonding” that, modified by evolutionary pressures and 
                            cultural values, has led to human styles of moral behavior. 
                            The result is a provocative genealogy of morals that asks us 
                            to reevaluate the priority given to religion, absolute rules, 
                            and pure reason in accounting for the basis of morality. A 
                            major new account of what really makes us moral, Braintrust 
                            challenges us to reconsider the origins of some of our most 
                            cherished values.

                                “Neurophilosophy is a pioneering work. As our 
                                understanding of the brain develops, philosophers 
                                will need to know more about the function of its 
                                parts, while neuroscientists will increasingly 
                                confront philosophical issues. This perceptive, 
                                lively and informative book combines both approaches 
                                in ail up to date and very readable manner.”
